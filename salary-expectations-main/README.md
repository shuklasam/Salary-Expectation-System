# Regression Models for Salary Prediction and Startup Profit Analysis

This repository contains regression models implemented in Python for predicting salary expectations based on employee levels and analyzing startup profits based on various expenditure categories.

## Overview

In this repository, you'll find Jupyter Notebook files for different regression models and analysis. The models covered include:

- Linear Regression
- Polynomial Regression
- Support Vector Regression (SVR)
- Decision Tree Regression
- Random Forest Regression
- Multiple Linear Regression (for startup profit analysis)

## Files and Directory Structure

- `salary_expectation.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing regression models for predicting employee salaries based on their levels in the organization.
- `startup_profit_analysis.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook for analyzing startup profits based on expenditures and location.
- `Postion_Salaries.csv`: Dataset for salary prediction.
- `50_Startups.csv`: Dataset for startup profit analysis.

## Dependencies

Make sure you have the following libraries installed before running the notebooks:

- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

You can install these libraries using `pip`:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
